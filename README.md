## Installation

This project does not require any libraries outside Anaconda. Python 3 was used for this project.

## Project Motivation

We compare the Airbnb data for Boston and Seattle to answer 3 questions

1. How did the price of the Airbnbs change over time?
2. What are the most expensive neighborhoods in each city?
3. What are the most important property features that drive Airbnb prices?
